# Payment Flow Update Report

## Summary

Successfully migrated the Peace2Hearts payment verification flow from deprecated client-side `verify-payment` calls to the new webhook-first `payment-status` endpoint. This eliminates the "DEPRECATED: Client verify-payment called" warnings and ensures proper payment processing.

## Files Updated

### Core Payment Services

1. **src/utils/payment/verificationService.ts**
   - Replaced `verify-payment` edge function call with `payment-status`
   - Updated to check for `status === 'captured'` instead of `verified` field
   - Simplified logic to focus on status checking only

2. **src/utils/payment/services/paymentVerificationService.ts**
   - Migrated from `verify-payment` to `payment-status` endpoint
   - Updated response handling for new status-based approach
   - Improved error handling for pending/failed states

### New Payment Status Hook

3. **src/hooks/payment/usePaymentStatus.ts** (NEW)
   - Dedicated hook for checking payment status via new endpoint
   - Supports polling with configurable intervals and max retries
   - Handles captured, failed, and pending states properly
   - Auto-stops polling when payment is resolved

### Updated Payment Hooks

4. **src/hooks/payment/usePaymentVerification.ts**
   - Refactored to use new `usePaymentStatus` hook
   - Replaced direct `verify-payment` calls with status polling
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing interfaces

5. **src/hooks/consultation/payment/usePaymentVerification.ts**
   - Updated to use `usePaymentStatus` for status checking
   - Fixed React import issue
   - Simplified verification logic using polling approach

### Test Files

6. **src/utils/testing/webhookIntegrationTest.ts**
   - Updated test to use `payment-status` endpoint instead of deprecated `verify-payment`

## Technical Changes

### Before (Deprecated Approach)
```javascript
// Direct client call to verify-payment (DEPRECATED)
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('verify-payment', {
  body: {
    paymentId,
    orderId,
    signature,
    bookingDetails: { ... }
  }
});
```

### After (New Approach)
```javascript
// Use payment-status endpoint for status checking
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('payment-status', {
  body: {
    order_id: orderId
  }
});

// Check if payment is captured
const isVerified = data.success && data.status === 'captured';
```

## Flow Changes

### Payment Verification Process

1. **Razorpay Payment Completion** → User completes payment on Razorpay
2. **Client Status Check** → Frontend calls `payment-status` endpoint
3. **Webhook Processing** → Razorpay webhook calls `verify-payment` (server-side only)
4. **Status Polling** → Frontend polls `payment-status` until payment is captured
5. **UI Update** → Show success/failure based on final status

### Status Handling

- **captured**: Payment successful, booking confirmed
- **failed**: Payment failed, show retry options
- **pending**: Payment processing, continue polling
- **not_found**: Order not found, show error

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Deprecated Warnings**: No more client-side `verify-payment` calls
2. **Proper Separation**: Client checks status, webhooks handle database operations
3. **Better Reliability**: Polling ensures eventual consistency
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation between status checking and payment processing
5. **Improved User Experience**: Real-time status updates via polling

## Testing Required

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Complete Booking Flow**:
   - Start booking from `/book-consultation`
   - Complete payment with test Razorpay credentials
   - Verify no "DEPRECATED" warnings in Supabase logs
   - Confirm payment record in `payments` table
   - Confirm booking record in `consultations` table
   - Verify confirmation email is sent

2. **Status API Testing**:
   - Test `GET /functions/v1/payment-status?order_id=<order_id>`
   - Verify proper JSON response format
   - Test with non-existent order ID

3. **Webhook Verification**:
   - Ensure Razorpay webhook still delivers to `/functions/v1/verify-payment`
   - Verify webhook processes correctly (creates DB records, sends emails)
   - Check that webhook logs show proper processing

### Expected Results

- ✅ No "DEPRECATED: Client verify-payment called" warnings
- ✅ Payment records created in `payments` table
- ✅ Booking records created in `consultations` table  
- ✅ Confirmation emails sent automatically
- ✅ Thank you page displays correctly
- ✅ Status API returns correct payment states

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, can revert the following files to their previous versions:
- `src/utils/payment/verificationService.ts`
- `src/utils/payment/services/paymentVerificationService.ts`
- `src/hooks/payment/usePaymentVerification.ts`
- `src/hooks/consultation/payment/usePaymentVerification.ts`

The `usePaymentStatus.ts` hook can be safely removed if rollback is needed.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy changes to staging environment
2. Test complete booking flow with test Razorpay keys
3. Monitor Supabase logs for elimination of deprecated warnings
4. Verify database records and email delivery
5. Deploy to production once testing confirms proper operation
